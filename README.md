# AI/ML Use Case Generation and Solution Proposal Tool

## 1. Introduction and Objectives

The objective of this project was to build a tool that generates AI/ML use cases, identifies relevant resources for their implementation, and proposes potential solutions based on a company's profile. The tool leverages the capabilities of natural language processing (NLP) to gather information about a company, suggest relevant AI/ML use cases, and propose possible generative AI (GenAI) solutions for each use case.

The process is automated using **Streamlit** for the user interface, **LangChain** for agent-based natural language processing tasks, and **OpenAI's GPT model** for generating insights. Additionally, the tool utilizes **Google Custom Search API** to fetch relevant data during the research phase.

## 2. Methodology

The implementation follows a four-step methodology:

### Step 1: Gathering Company Information
The user enters the name of a company, and the tool collects relevant information about the company, such as its industry, offerings, and strategic goals. This information is retrieved from the web using Google Custom Search.  
The collected data forms the foundation for subsequent steps.

### Step 2: Generating AI/ML Use Cases
Based on the company’s profile, AI/ML use cases are brainstormed. The tool generates innovative use cases, considering various aspects like operations, customer experience, and product development.  
These use cases serve as the primary starting point for identifying potential resources.

### Step 3: Resource Collection for Use Cases
For each generated use case, the tool identifies and collects relevant resources (datasets, libraries, tools, articles, etc.) from platforms like **Kaggle**, **Hugging Face**, **GitHub**, and **Google Scholar**.  
These resources are curated to help the user implement the proposed use cases.

### Step 4: Proposing GenAI Solutions
Finally, the tool proposes potential generative AI (GenAI) solutions tailored to the company’s needs. These solutions leverage AI technologies such as document search, automated report generation, and AI-powered chat systems.  
The GenAI solutions are presented as actionable suggestions for improving the company’s processes and operations.

Each of these steps is carried out using separate LangChain agents, each responsible for a specific task (e.g., research, idea generation, resource collection, etc.). The results of each step are displayed in **Streamlit** as bullet points, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding.

## 3. Architecture Flowchart

Below is a flowchart that illustrates the architecture of the AI/ML Use Case Generation and Solution Proposal tool:

User Input: Company Name 
-> Step 1: Gather Company Information via Google Custom Search API 
-> Step 2: Generate AI/ML Use Cases based on Company Profile (LangChain Agent) 
-> Step 3: Collect Resources (Datasets, Libraries, etc.) for Use Cases (LangChain) 
-> Step 4: Propose GenAI Solutions (LangChain) 
-> Results Displayed in Streamlit (Bullet Points) 
-> Export Results to CSV for Download


## 4. Results

The tool's output consists of several key components, presented in **Streamlit**:

- **Company Information**: A summary of the company’s profile, industry, key offerings, and any relevant news or reports.
- **Generated AI/ML Use Cases**: A list of AI/ML use cases that can be implemented for the company. These cover various business functions, such as operations, customer experience, and product development.
- **Relevant Resources**: For each generated use case, a list of datasets, libraries, tools, and articles is provided. These resources are gathered from reputable platforms like Kaggle, Hugging Face, GitHub, and Google Scholar.
- **Proposed GenAI Solutions**: Tailored generative AI solutions that can address the company's challenges or help enhance its offerings. Each solution includes a brief description of how it can be applied to the company's processes.

The results are presented as bullet points to enhance readability and user experience. The user can download the results in **CSV format** for further analysis or use.

## 5. Conclusions

This tool automates the process of researching a company, generating AI/ML use cases, collecting resources for their implementation, and proposing GenAI solutions. By integrating powerful NLP models (via LangChain and OpenAI), the tool is able to produce highly relevant and creative outputs tailored to the company’s needs.

### Key Benefits:
- **Efficiency**: Automates the research, brainstorming, and solution proposal processes.
- **Customization**: Generates AI/ML use cases and solutions specific to the company’s profile.
- **Comprehensiveness**: Provides resources for each use case, making it easier for users to implement the proposed solutions.
- **Scalability**: Can be extended to handle more complex tasks or additional industries.

### Limitations:
- The accuracy of results depends on the quality of data retrieved via Google Custom Search, which may vary.
- The generated use cases and solutions are limited to the models' capabilities and the information available in the training data.

### Future enhancements could include more fine-tuned models, more advanced resource gathering techniques, or integration with specific data platforms for more accurate results.

## 6. Future Work

To enhance this tool, future work could focus on the following areas:

- **Integrating with more data sources**: Beyond Google Custom Search, integrating with business-specific databases or proprietary data sources could provide more precise company insights.
- **Adding more interactivity**: Allowing users to refine or filter AI/ML use cases and resources dynamically would improve the user experience.
- **Enhancing Solution Proposals**: Implementing a more structured approach to generating GenAI solutions, including specific technical steps and project timelines, would provide users with a more actionable output.
